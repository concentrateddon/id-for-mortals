# Part 2: Telling a Story #
Our brains are _story makers_. We try to fit everything we learn into the larger pattern and narrative of our lives, and so one of the best ways to help our brains learn more easily is to provide a ready-made story. There's a real art to this, and it's perhaps the most important Part of this book.

# Why Stories Work
Other than oddball stories (ABC's _How to Get Away with Murder_ springs to mind) where you start with the end of the story, and then quickly get "THREE WEEKS EARLIER" and work through the story backwards, most stories are _sequential_. Actually, simply saying that something is sequential isn't useful, because even a story that's told backwards can be sequential; it's just in the opposite order. The "right" order, for our brains, is based on our built-in understanding of _causality_. That is, we're accustomed to seeing a cause first, and then its effect. We drop a glass of water, _then_ the glass shatters, _then_ the floor is wet. When we witness the entire story, we know why the floor is wet and the glass is broken. 

Our brains are _so_ hardwired for this kind of understanding that it's almost impossible to get our brains to stop doing it, even when we know they're drawing the wrong conclusions. And when we don't see the _cause_ of something, we can make some pretty egregious mistakes in analyzing the _effects_. Ever walk into the kitchen, see something spilled on the floor, and then immediately assume the kid/pet/ghost was the cause? You don't _know_ they are, but your brain has seen them be the cause often enough that it just assumes it's the cause this time, too. Show someone a wrecked car and their brains will immediately start filling in the _start_ of the story, based on their past experiences. Ask ten people in a crowd what happened, and you'll get a bunch of different answers, based on their past experiences. Some may temporize their theory with words like "maybe," but very few, you'll find, will come right out and admit they don't know. Our brains _need_ a complete story, and they'll happily make one up where none exists. For proof, look no further than the many myths our ancient ancestors to created to explain how we all got on this planet in the first place.

So as a learning technique, stories work because _that's how our brains work_. Give a hammer to someone who has never seen a hammer before, tell them, "this will hurt your thumb," and they won't really _learn_ anything. They haven't seen a cause, let alone an effect; they haven't been told a _story_. You may have thought you were saving them some time by getting straight to the point, but our brains aren't wired for time-saving. They're wired to learn from experiences, and stories embody those experiences.

# The Elements of a Good Story
Once we accept the story-based nature of our brains' learning system, we need to start looking at what the brain needs in a story to make that story effective. Really, you only have to look at some of your culture's oldest children's stories--fairy tales, that is--to see the best elements boiled down to their absolute essence.

First, a story needs to be _relatable_ right from the outset. If the learner can't relate to the story's basic premise, then you'll lose them immediately. That's why good teachers talk about making the learner the _hero_ of the story. Put learners into a position they've experienced before, or can easily imagine themselves in, as a starting point. This is where you create common ground with your learner, and it requires that you first have a clear, unambiguous definition of who your audience is. In _Hansel and Gretel_, two children start with a horrible parent abandoning them because they eat too much. This is something most children can instinctively relate to, because fear of abandonment is baked into our brains (when teaching children, who have so little experience of their own, you often have to start with these built-in fears and biases to find "common ground"). With adult learning, we almost always start with familiar analogies (in my industry of information technology, the analogies always seem to involve cars, which are a near-universal experience in most parts of the world). This need to find common ground as a starting point _will_ limit how much you can teach in a given time period. If you're trying to teach quantum physics to a teenager, your "common ground" is going to be pretty far away from the end goal, and that goal might in fact not be achievable in the time you've got. 

Second, a story needs to follow a clear cause-and-effect pattern. Hansel collected pebbles, used them to lay a trail, and used that trail to get himself and Gretel home after their mother tried to abandon them the first time. Their mother then prevented them from leaving the house until the next attempt, so that they could not gather more pebbles. This is a clear cause-and-effect sequence. Nowhere in the story are there "spoilers," right? You didn't read, "Hansel collected pebbles, but he knew that would only work for one attempt. Next time he figured he'd use a slice of bread." You've lost the causality of the story with the foreshadowing. I try to avoid foreshadowing whenever possible; I don't tell students what they're going to learn in the future, and instead focus on what they're learning _right now_. Foreshadowing causes the brain to build a kind of expectation-placeholder, which does nothing to help the _current_ learning task.

Third, a story needs to expose the learners to problems, then the solution, and right into the next problem. This is one of the most difficult tasks in building a storyline, because you ideally want to address _one_ problem at a time, let the learner absorb the fact that it's a problem, and then address _just_ that problem. The solution should lead as naturally as possible into the _next_ problem, keeping the brain hungry for a steady diet of solutions. That's how we learn. We're not _removing_ the experience of the problems themselves, just shortcutting it a bit. "Don't you hate walking into a dark room? And you don't always want to put a lamp right next to the door, right? So you might put a lamp on the far side of the room. But then you'd still have to walk through a dark room to reach it! But, we could put an electrical outlet over there, and wire it back to a light switch right by the door! But, we might have a hard time remembering which outlet is controlled by the switch, which means we could accidentally plug a clock into it and end up switching the clock off. But, we could install that outlet upside-down, so it was visually apparent it was different somehow." Problem, solution, problem, solution. So long as each problem is one the learner can see and relate to, the sequence doesn't necessarily have to be the exact one they'd run across if they were just figuring this out on their own.

Fourth, the story needs to have a definite ending, and you need to call it out. "And so now you'll never have to walk through a dark room again!" The ending needs to connect right back to the problem statement that started the story, subtly informing the learner that the entire story is now part of their "common ground," familiar place. The ending tells the brain that the story is concluded, and that the brain can now start processing the story into long-term memory.

Fifth, the story must continually connect to learners' existing experiences, often through familiar analogies. Introduce only one new concept or idea at a time, and immediately relate it to the learner through a sub-story or analogy. This helps new concepts immediately connect to strong neural networks in the learner's brains, giving them a better chance of synthesizing the new material.

Sixth and finally, understand the limits of human learning and retention. Our experiences each day are kept in short-term memory, which has a finite amount of storage in each person. It isn't until that night, when we go to bed, that the brain reviews the day's events, rebuilds neural networks, and expands those networks to include new experiences. If you exceed what I call the Daily Learning Capacity, learners won't retain what you've taught, and you'll have to start over the next day. Hansel and Gretel taught us just a couple of moral lessons in their one story together; they didn't try to aim for any more than that. The actual amount a person can learn in a given period of time varies pretty drastically. Well-constructed stories that are adjacent to existing, strong experiences can often teach more than something more esoteric or novel, for example. In my _Month of Lunches_ series, for example, I mandated no more than one hour's worth of learning (based on the average adult reading speed, that dictated chapter lengths) per day. That places some strong limits on how much is taught at once, and lets the learner's brain process the information overnight before taking on new information the next day.

# Recall and Relate
Don't forget that repetition is our brains' way of figuring out what is most important to our survival. Things we experience more often are, by the brain's definition, more relevant, and more worthy of a strong neural network. Things we're forced to recall develop a stronger "recall" ability in our brains, and develop stronger synaptic connections with other information and experiences.

For example, many of the websites you probably use on a day to day basis are big and complex. Once you start drilling down through pages, it's often easy to forget where you came from, unless you just use your browser's "Back" button a lot. You've probably noticed that some sites will, near the top of each page, try to show you the "path" you've taken. It's usually a series of links, like this:

```
Home > Your Account > Privacy Controls > Who Can See Your Data
```

In the world of web design, this element is literally called a _breadcrumb_, recalling poor Hansel and Gretel, who tried to leave a trail of breadcrumbs the second time their mother abandoned them in the first. Of course, on the web, there are no birds to eat our breadcrumbs, so we can always find our way Home.

See what I did, there? I started with the familiar shared experience of complex web sites. I pointed out a solution, and then connected it with information you'd learned earlier. Your brain, whether you realize it or not, had a big "OMG!" moment. _Breadcrumbs_ will now forever hold a stronger importance in your brain, because that visceral story of Hansel and Gretel now has a real-world, familiar application that solves a problem you've experienced personally. 

This recall-and-relate technique is what lets good teachers conduct full-day learning sessions. If you think of each day as a series of stories, with each story forcing learners to recall from previous stories and relate to the current one, then you start forcing the brain to prioritize information on-the-fly. That night, even after a long day of learning, the synapses connecting the most important facts are already flagged for strengthening. Of course, you have to take great care to identify the most important things you want learners to learn and retain, and make _those_ the subject of your recall-and-relate moments. 

And that's where the real instructional design challenge happens. You need to find the one, central theme of your overall story arc, and that is like an immense steel girder. From that girder, you can hang your individual stories. That girder is what you keep coming back to, though. It's where you want the strongest synaptic thread in your learners' brains, and you rely on its recall strength to help learners recall the other, smaller stories that make up the learning experience. Take the _Star Wars_ saga as an example. Its main thread, throughout, was the Skywalker family: Anakin, Luke and Leia, and eventually Leia's son Ben. Numerous other stories attached to that main arc, and we can easily recall moments with Jabba, Emperor Palpatine, Padma, and more, because they're all connected to that central Skywalker theme. That central theme is so strong that we can now imagine other stories that have no direct connection to the Skywalkers, such as the stories told in _Rogue One_ and _Solo_. We "learned" each of those stories in just a couple of hours apiece, and most of us can easily recall the sequence and major events of each one through their connection to the overall backbone.

_This_ is where the true art of instructional design lies. So how do you find the Skywalker Saga in whatever it is you need to teach?

Start by defining who your learner _is_ at the _Phantom Menace_ stage of your story. The beginning. What do they know? What have they experienced? What common ground will you have with them? Then define who they are at the end of _Episode IX_. How are they different? What have they become? What can they do now, that they couldn't do in the beginning? Then start analyzing the gap between those two extremes. Sometime it's easiest to start with the end state, and work backwards. _OK, to get to this endpoint, the last thing they're going to need to learn is Z. In order to learn Z, I'm going to have to teach them Y. But Y isn't going to be possible unless they first know X._ And so on. Each of those steps form the smaller stories you'll tell, creating the granular learning experiences that take just a short period of time apiece. They're the episodes in your saga, if you will. And as you do that analysis, look for the common threads that will connect those episodes. _Create_ a storyline where each episode picks up from a thread of the previous episode. Look for that strong backbone that defines the entire arc, and construct your analogies and other learning aids around that backbone.

It's not easy, but few things really worth doing are.

# Storytelling Checklist
Here's a quick summary of this Part, which you can use to evaluate the stories you construct for your learners:

1. Start on common ground. Make the learner the "hero" of the story by starting in a familiar, relatable situation.
2. Stick with a linear, cause-and-effect storyline. Avoid foreshadowing and let each portion of the story unfold in sequence.
3. Create a story that introduces problems the learner can relate to, and then a sensible solution for each problem, which should lead right into the next problem, and solution, and so on.
4. Make a definitive ending statement that connects back to the story's initial problem statement, marking the end of the story and cueing the brain to begin long-term archival.
5. Constantly relate new story points to learners' existing experiences, often through analogy.
6. Carefully limit how many new things you try to teach in one sitting.
7. Use recall-and-relate to construct multi-part stories, forcing the brain to recall key bits and connect them to the current story. This strengthens the memory and lets you tell longer, connected stories in a single learning session.
