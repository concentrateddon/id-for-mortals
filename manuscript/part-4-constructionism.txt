# Part 4: Constructionism #
_Constructionism_ is an instructional design technique that, for me, is incredibly successful in taking learners (including adults) from memorization all the way through to application and beyond. It's a bit of a scary technique for some teachers, and definitely so for some learners, so you have to approach it with a bit of caution. But sometimes the things most worth achieving are the hardest, and so I wanted to dedicate a Part of this book to the topic.

# A Non-Boring History of Constructionism
Loosely connected to _experiential learning_, which basically means "learn by doing" if I may be permitted to vastly gloss over the details, constructionism is an approach where learners construct their own mental models to understand the topic at hand. It's a discovery-based kind of learning, albeit a very _guided_ kind of discovery. The teacher serves more as a _facilitator_, guiding the students through a series of carefully constructed discovery experiences. In each, students are essentially given or pointed to the resources they'll need to complete a small project, and then let loose on their own or in very small groups. There's rarely a lecture, unless there are some core concepts or goals that need to be delivered first. There are never step-by-step instructions; the whole point is to create an environment that invites failure-and-recovery, which is how our brains ultimately learn best. 

Constructionism was first formally defined by Syemour Papert in a proposal to the National Science Foundation, entitled _A New Opportunity for Elementary Science Education_[^anofese]. Papert has gone to pains[^pains] to point out that constructionism is more complex than just giving students some task and setting them free; while that's certainly a good elevator-pitch way of describing the theory, there's actually a lot of instructional design and thinking that needs to go into it. Papert's work[^logo] was mainly focused on children, but I've found it to be incredibly useful in teaching adults. My first use of constructionism was out of sheer necessity: I needed to write a computer programming textbook for classes where the teacher would have little subject matter knowledge. Turning the teacher into a _faciliator_, and stressing the need for self-created learning models, was the only way to make it happen.

 # Core Tenets of Constructionism
The main idea behind constructionism is to give learners some well-scoped project to work on in the topic being taught, and to expose them to whatever adjunct resources they might need to solve the problem. For example, to teach someone to learn to change a tire, you'd put a tire-changing manual in front of them, along with a pile of the necessary tools, and let 'em have at it. Although, that's not _quite_ the end of it. In reality, you'd probably just give them a car with a flat tire and ask them to make it drivable again. You see, constructionism is ideally about larger-scale outcomes than it is smaller, intermediate tasks. Nobody _wants_ to change a tire; that's not an _outcome_. Changing the tire is the _means_ to the outcome, which is being able to drive the car. People _want_ to be able to drive their cars, which is what makes that an outcome.

Starting with that big-picture outcome is a key to constructionism, and it's what helps people learn to an _application_ level rather than simple memorizing a series of steps. It also allows each learner's unique brain to construct a worldview that is uniquely theirs, rather than trying to win them over to the teacher's worldview. Some learners might figure out how to operate the jack first; others might try to loosen the lug nuts without jacking the car up first. That "choose your own adventure" process lets each brain approach the problem in its own way, which makes each brain more receptive to whatever solutions it comes up with. You're bypassing "the filter," this way, because you're not hanging out information that might be filtered. All the information that's _constructed_ (see what I did, there?) is being built _internally_, inside the filters.

Learners also need to know that failure is an option, and that that's okay. This is a big thing to overcome, because people naturally get frustrated when they see others around them succeeding and perceive that they, themselves, are failing. They're looking stupid, they know it, and they don't like it. That's why, as a practical matter, constructionism needs to start off small, with things you know a learner can succeed at, and then built into bigger and bigger things. It means that initial tasks are almost "gimmes," and perhaps not entirely in keeping with constructionism's goals, so that you can create some trust and even a sense of play in the learning environment. This is _especially_ important with fear-avoiding adult learners.

You also need to be very careful about matching tasks and the learners' cognitive readiness. In the real world, this usually boils down to being _extremely_ clear about learning prerequisites, and being _very_ careful to enforce your prerequisites. If a learner isn't ready for what you're trying to teach, then trying to wedge them in anyway is just going to create a frustrating experience for everyone. 

Constructionism also insists that learners have time to reflect on what they've learned, and I've found that friendly, open discussions are a good way to do that. "So, did anyone try anything that they definitely wouldn't try again?" "Did anyone do something and then later decide doing it in a different order would have been better?" Turn learners into teachers, and get them to not only explain the problem, but explain how they solved it, and what did and didn't work.

Finally, you ideally want to give students a slightly different context in which to _use the same skills they just developed_. Perhaps they now need to change a bicycle tire, or a motorcycle tire, or a truck tire, or a wheelbarrow tire. They'll need some of the same stuff that they used on the car, but they'll also need different stuff for each new scenario. This process reinforces the core things they're learning, and helps them construct a larger worldview, which is a key step on moving them toward synthesis and evaluation. _Variations on a theme_ let the brain strengthen core memories through repeated recall and use, while letting it expand the network of neurons that hold each memory, creating a new and bigger story for itself.
