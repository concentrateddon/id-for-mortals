# Introduction
I taught my first formal class in 1996, and wrote my first classroom courseware in 1998. I immediately fell in love with teaching, writing, and instructional design. As many people do when they fall in love with something, I started trying to learn everything I could about it. This was before Amazon and E-Z online access to Every Book Ever Written, of course, but I tried not to let that stop me.

Sadly, I encountered a lot of hurdles. Most of what I was able to dig up at the library and bookshops was extremely academic, and frankly hard (and boring) to read. It required a lot of instructional design background that I, having never even attended college, didn't have and didn't have the patience to acquire. The few books I did find that were written for a non-academic audience were _so_ incredibly condescending in tone, I couldn't make it through more than a few pages at a time. "So you want to learn about instructional design? Well, good for you! It is a very challenging yet rewarding topic, and you are making a good first step on what will be a wonderful journey!" Blurgh.

I tried not to let it deter me. I devoured what I could find on cognitive science, instructional design, and more. I learned to gleefully differentiate between _pedagogy_ and _andragogy_,  and eventually learned that nobody cared about the difference, which initially struck me as a problem, and then I got over it. I practiced on my students, and over time refined a set of instructional design guidelines for myself. I shared those in _The Nine Principals of Immediately Effective Instruction_, a book still available for free on my website, DonJones.com. Professionally, I moved into a position that focused heavily on instructional design, and had access to even more guinea pigs and data gathering, and wrote more than a few internal documents on better design and delivery.

This book is the result. It's as plain-English as I can make it, and as outcome-oriented as I can manage. It's got plenty of theory, but I back it up with actionable things you can do in your everyday life as someone who shares skills and knowledge. I'm a big fan of checklists, and while this book doesn't really _have_ any checklists per se, it's definitely laid out in a checklist-style fashion. If you've read any of my earlier, less-formally published works, you'll recognize plenty of familiar things, but you'll also see a lot more. Hopefully, you'll find everything to be better organized for a more "what can I actually do" mindset.

I hope you find it helpful.

# Let's Define Instructional Design
The phrase _instructional design_ has been co-opted by a lot of different stakeholders over the years, so let me just explain how _I_ use the term in this book.

For me, instructional _design_ isn't quite the same as instructional _authoring_, and it's different still from instructional _delivery_. A _designer_ lays out the strategy, and outlines the story that will be told to learners. A designer worries about _how_ people will learn, and what _objectives_ they're going to be taught. You run around on the Internet today, and it's easy to get the impression that a designer is also worried about which stock photos to use on slides, and what kind of Word template to use; for me, that's an _authoring_ job, and it's not something I get into in this book. You'll also see "instructional design" tips like "don't have a boring voice," which for me is very much a _delivery_ problem, and so you won't see much of that in this book, either.

I suppose over time "instructional design" has just gotten applied to a wider range of job roles and I didn't notice. That's fine, of course, but I wanted to be clear where _this_ book is headed, so that you're not disappointed.
